`astro-skeleton` comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in the `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how to import and use the gallery MDX component:

When viewing this page in the browser, you should see the gallery above the code block.

import ImageGallery from "~/components/mdx/integrations/swiper/ImageGallery.astro";
import Image1 from "~/content/posts/images/claudio-schwarz-pQ_SEJg8rII-unsplash.jpg";
import Image2 from "~/content/posts/images/eugene-golovesov-k-ZgCSdH8Hk-unsplash.jpg";
import Image3 from "~/content/posts/images/fons-heijnsbroek-U8EuOr-hG_0-unsplash.jpg";
import Image4 from "~/content/posts/images/geronimo-giqueaux-H26GZk6nro8-unsplash.jpg";

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    { src: Image1, alt: "Example 1" },
    { src: Image2, alt: "Example 2" },
    { src: Image3, alt: "Example 3" },
    { src: Image4, alt: "Example 4" },
  ]}
/>

```
import ImageGallery from "~/components/mdx/integrations/swiper/ImageGallery.astro";
import Image1 from "~/content/posts/images/claudio-schwarz-pQ_SEJg8rII-unsplash.jpg";
import Image2 from "~/content/posts/images/eugene-golovesov-k-ZgCSdH8Hk-unsplash.jpg";
import Image3 from "~/content/posts/images/fons-heijnsbroek-U8EuOr-hG_0-unsplash.jpg";
import Image4 from "~/content/posts/images/geronimo-giqueaux-H26GZk6nro8-unsplash.jpg";

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    { src: Image1, alt: "Example 1" },
    { src: Image2, alt: "Example 2" },
    { src: Image3, alt: "Example 3" },
    { src: Image4, alt: "Example 4" },
  ]}
/>
```
